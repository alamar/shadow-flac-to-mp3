This is a script to convert all FLAC files found in directory INPUT
into mp3 files in directory OUTPUT.

./shadow-flac-to-mp3.sh master recoded

It also transfers vital tags from flac to mp3, in ID3v2 UTF-8 format.

It uses flac, lame, parallel and eyeD3 for tags.

All settings are hardcoded: three parallel processes, cbr 320 kbps.
It is incremental: it would not retranscode any files unless the original
or the script itself has changed. It also would not leave partially
recorded files lying around pretending to be good in case of system failure.

I hope it would not delete all your music collection.
